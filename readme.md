# Pagerank school project

The project constructs four predefined graphs and iteratively calculates the pagerank for each page of each graph.

Here are the example graphs: ![example_graphs](example_graphs.png)

The console printed values associate as follows: "page_id: pagerank"

Where page_id is constructed starting at a1 = 0 and ends with c4 = 10
